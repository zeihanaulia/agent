## 🎯 Executive Summary

### Problem
Users have excellent foundation docs but no guidance for scaling beyond single-agent system.

### Solution
Integrate feature request (multi-agent orchestration) with existing docs through layered architecture.

### Approach
- Keep 9 existing docs (foundation)
- Add 9 new advanced docs (from feature request)
- Enhance 4 existing docs with 1,500 lines
- Create master index for navigation

### Timeline
3.5 days of work to implement

### Risk
Very low (non-breaking, clear structure)

### Value
Very high (complete ecosystem, progressive scaling, production ready)

### Recommendation
**PROCEED WITH HYBRID INTEGRATION STRATEGY**
