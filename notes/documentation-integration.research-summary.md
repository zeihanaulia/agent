## ✅ Recommendations

### DO ✅
1. ✅ Keep all 9 existing documents unchanged (foundation)
2. ✅ Create 9 new advanced orchestration documents from FR
3. ✅ Enhance 4 existing documents with 1,500 lines of additions
4. ✅ Use master index as primary navigation hub
5. ✅ Create learning paths (A-E) for different user types
